Once upon a time, there was a dog named 'Doge'. He was a happy little Shiba Inu dog. But he had a problem.

Doge always wants to travel around the world and enjoy all kinds of food. However, no airline would like to give him a ride. He feels sad.

He eventually gived up taking an airplane and started to thinking about other ways to travel.Oneday, He wandered to the harbor and tried to get on a boat, but he didn't realize that Shiba Inu dogs are natural swimmers, and earth is mostly made by water. 

Doge used his newly discovered swimming talents to swim all the way across the ocean. Turns out, he didn't need a boat or a plane to be able to travel around the world.
